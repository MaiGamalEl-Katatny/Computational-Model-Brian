# Computational-Model-Brian
In this project, a computational spiking network model of two cortical brain regions is implemented using Brian2 simulator. Each network consists of 800 excitatory neurons and 200 inhibitory neurons. 
This project is based on the model presented in: Ramirez-Mahaluf, Juan P., et al. "A computational model of Major Depression: the role of glutamate dysfunction on cingulo-frontal network dynamics." Cerebral cortex 27.1 (2017): 660-679.
